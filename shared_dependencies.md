1. React: Used in "src/index.tsx", "src/App.tsx", "src/components/Login.tsx", "src/components/Signup.tsx", "src/components/Logout.tsx", "src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx". It's the main library for building the user interface.

2. Typescript: Used in all ".tsx" and ".ts" files. It's a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.

3. Firebase Authentication: Used in "src/services/auth.ts". It's a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code.

4. User data schema: Defined in "src/types/user.ts" and used in "src/components/Login.tsx", "src/components/Signup.tsx", "src/services/auth.ts". It describes the structure of a user object.

5. CSS-in-JS: Used in all ".ts" files in "src/styles". It's a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files.

6. ReactDOM: Used in "src/index.tsx". It provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements.

7. ProtectedRoute function: Defined in "src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx" and used in "src/App.tsx". It's a function that wraps the React Router Route component and redirects the user to the login page if they are not authenticated.

11. Package.json: It's a file that includes metadata about the app like the project's dependencies, which are shared across all project files.

12. Gitignore: It's a file that specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, which affects all project files.
